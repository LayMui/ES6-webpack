Learn Webpack

Benefits of Webpack:
```
1. It bundles modules into 1 js.file 
reduces alot of time spent loading resources and can even prevent
errors where JS code relies on another one being loaded but it hasn't yet

2. It comes with dev server - All we have to do is to write one line in our code and then we've a whole local development scheme that gets live code updating.

3. Install the modules
    webpack
    webpack-cli

4. Run yarn start (webpack in development)
the result: dist/main.js

5. Run yarn build (webpack in production)
the result: dist/main.js more shorter and condensed optimized for production
